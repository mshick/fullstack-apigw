# Fullstack CRUD(L) API with NextJS and AWS CDK

![pet API GW Architecture Diagram](./pet-api-gateway-fullstack.drawio.png)

This repo follows a YouTube series designed to teach developers how to create fullstack application using NextJS and the AWS CDK. This repo uses a `PetAPI` instead of a `BookAPI`, but all the concepts are exactly the same.

In addition to leaving comments on the YouTube videos themselves, feel free to file an issue for suggestions and corrections you'd like to see before issuing a PR.
